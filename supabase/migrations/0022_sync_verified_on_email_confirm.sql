-- OpenHRApp — Sync profiles.verified when email is confirmed
-- When a user clicks the confirmation link, Supabase Auth sets
-- auth.users.email_confirmed_at but nothing propagates that to
-- public.profiles.verified.  This trigger closes that gap so
-- the login gate (auth.service.ts:48) no longer blocks users
-- whose email is already confirmed.
