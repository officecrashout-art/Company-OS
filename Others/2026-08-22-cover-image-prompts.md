# OpenHRApp — Cover Image Prompts

> Regenerated 2026-08-22. 23 articles still have no cover image
> — 1 blog post and 22 guides.
>
> **The palette changed.** These prompts use the Daylight palette the public
> pages now use (deep teal #1C6E7E on white), not the app indigo the previous
> sheet specified. Covers sit inside Daylight cards and link previews; an indigo
> cover on a teal page is the clash that had to be removed from the blog sidebar.
> Do not mix sheets — regenerate rather than reusing older prompts.

**Output spec — the same for every image:**

| Setting | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Dimensions | **1200 x 630** (or 1920 x 1080) | Both are the 1.91:1 / 16:9 ratio link-preview cards expect. Below 600 x 315 the card degrades to a small square thumbnail. |
| Format to generate | **PNG or JPEG** | Either is fine — do not hand-convert. |
| Format actually stored | **JPEG**, automatically | `convertFileToJpeg(file, 0.85, 1920)` runs on every cover upload (`blog.service.ts`, `tutorial.service.ts`), re-encoding to JPEG at quality 0.85 and capping the long edge at 1920px. PNG transparency is composited onto white first, because JPEG has no alpha channel and transparent pixels would otherwise turn black. |
| Do not upload WebP | — | Facebook, LinkedIn, X, and WhatsApp do not render WebP in link previews. Shipping WebP is the exact bug that made every shared OpenHR link show a blank card. The conversion above protects you, but generating WebP wastes a step. |
| Text in image | **None** | Cards crop unpredictably and overlay their own title. Text baked into the image gets cut in half. |
| Safe area | Keep the subject in the **left two thirds** | The right side is where crops and overlays land. |

**Alt text is already handled.** OpenHRApp has no `cover_alt` field — every cover
renders with the article title as its alt text, and the prerendered document derives
`og:image:alt` the same way. The suggested `alt` on each entry below is reference
only, for reusing an image somewhere that does need one. There is nothing to paste it
into here, and nothing to remember to set.

**Removing the Gemini watermark**

Gemini stamps its logo into the bottom-right corner. It cannot be prompted away, so the
plan is to generate the image with dead space there and crop it off. Each entry below
carries a second **watermark-safe** prompt that instructs the model to keep the bottom 15%
of the frame as plain background and leave the bottom-right corner completely empty.

The crop is a step you want regardless: 16:9 is 1.778:1 and link-preview cards want
1.91:1, so trimming about 7% off the bottom fixes the aspect ratio *and* takes the
watermark with it.

1. Generate with the watermark-safe prompt at the largest size offered (2048px+ long edge).
2. Crop **10% off the bottom** — comfortably more than the logo needs, and the reserved
   strip means nothing is lost. On a 2048 x 1152 image that is a 115px strip.
3. Resize the result to 1200 x 630, cropping a little from the right if needed. The subject
   is composed in the upper-left two thirds precisely so this is safe.

Any image editor does this. From the command line with ImageMagick:

```bash
# crop 10% off the bottom, then fit to 1200x630
magick in.png -gravity North -crop 100%x90% +repage \
  -resize 1200x630^ -gravity NorthWest -extent 1200x630 out.jpg
```

Verify the corner is clean before uploading — a cropped-but-still-visible logo is worse
than none, because it reads as a stock image.

## After generating

Save each image as `<slug>.png` into one folder, then upload them all at once:

```
node --env-file=.env.cloud scripts/upload-cover-images.mjs ./covers          # dry run
node --env-file=.env.cloud scripts/upload-cover-images.mjs ./covers --apply  # write
```

The uploader matches files to articles by filename, so the slug in the filename
has to be exact. It reports anything it cannot match rather than guessing.
