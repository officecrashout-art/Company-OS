# OpenHRApp — Guide Video Shot Lists

> Generated from the live guides. 25 guides, 170 clips of about 8s each.
> Clips are derived from each guide's own section headings, so the video follows the same
> steps as the written guide rather than inventing a parallel structure.

**How to use this file**

Each guide below is broken into clips of about 8 seconds. Generate them one at
a time, then cut them together in that order. Clips are short because current text-to-video
models cap out around 8 seconds per generation — asking one prompt for a
two-minute explainer produces drift, where the style wanders partway through and the result
cannot be cut with anything else.

**Output spec — the same for every clip:**

| Setting | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Resolution | **1920 x 1080** | 16:9. Downscale for social later; never upscale. |
| Frame rate | 24 or 30 fps, **the same for every clip** | Mixing frame rates in one timeline causes visible judder at the cuts. |
| Clip length | ~8s | The practical ceiling for a coherent single generation. |
| On-screen text | **None generated** | All on-screen text is added in the editor. The negative prompt forbids generated lettering. |
| Audio | **None generated** | Add voiceover and music in the editor so they can be revised without regenerating. |

**Why the style block is repeated in every prompt.** Clips generated in separate calls drift
apart — different palette, different line weight, different camera energy — and drifting
clips cannot be cut together. The identical style block in every prompt is what makes the
takes match.

**Assembly**

1. Generate each clip, keeping the suggested filename so the sort order *is* the edit order.
2. Drop them on the timeline in order. Straight cuts; no transitions. Cross-dissolves on
   flat vector motion look like a mistake.
3. Record the voiceover first, then trim each clip to the narration rather than the reverse.
   Clips can be slowed slightly to fit; speeding them up reads as nervous.
4. Add on-screen text in the editor, using the **On screen** value given for each clip.
5. Burn in captions or ship a `.srt`. Most viewers watch muted, and caption text is
   indexable in a way that spoken audio is not.
6. Export H.264 MP4, 1080p, and keep it under about 100 MB so it can be hosted directly.

**After publishing.** A guide page with an embedded video can carry `VideoObject` structured
data — thumbnail, duration, upload date, and a description — which is what produces a video
thumbnail in search results. The prerender middleware already emits `TechArticle` for guides;
`VideoObject` would be an addition to it, not a replacement.
